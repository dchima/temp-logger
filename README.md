This project entailed the use of an Embedded system to perform the function of detecting,
logging and displaying of current environment temperature. This embedded device is
known as a Temperature Logger or Temperature Logging device. The embedded
device makes use of a microcontroller device with CPU, memory and I/O peripheral
characteristics. The microcontroller is embedded onto the device also containing a
temperature sensor, LCD unit, buttons and switches, and a battery power unit.

The aim of the project was to configure the temperature sensor to be read by the
micro-controller which then logs the data per minute into a CSV file in its memory. The
Logged data is then to be displayed by the LCD unit on the device, with a plot of the
real time data and logging state, with each state of the LCD to be navigable via button
pushes. The switches on the device is also used to turn logging on/off.

Gear:
1. TMP102 temperature sensor
2. NXP LPC1786 micro-controller
3. Mokia LCD display (N5110)
4. PCB board
5. Battery
6. LEDs and Switches
7. mbed online compiler
